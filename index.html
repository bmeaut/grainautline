<p>GrainAutLine is an application with state-of-the-art image processing functions designed for geology applications.
Its primary goal is to automate the analysis of thinsection images as much as possible.</p>

<p>The current version aims for grain border detection, as this is a starting point for many applications. Once the grain boundaries are precisely known, several statistics like histogram of grain size or the number of neighbouring grains can be easily retrieved.</p>

<p>GrainAutLine follows a semi-automatic approach: a special drawing application is provided which has many high-level functions to accelerate the drawing of the grain boundaries. Our goal is to achieve an almost entirely automatic solution, but as this is not realistic in many applications, the user is given the chance to fully supervise all operations, and apply corrections whenever necessary. This way, the user does not have to rely on the automatic functions, but as the system is evolving, with time, less and less user interaction will be required.</p>
