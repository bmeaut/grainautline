{"name":"GrainAutLine","tagline":"GrainAutLine: image processing for geology and material sciences","body":"### Welcome to GrainAutLine\r\n\r\nGrainAutLine is an application with state-of-the-art image processing functions designed for geology applications.\r\nIts primary goal is to automate the analysis of thinsection images as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe current version aims for grain border detection, as this is a starting point for many applications. Once the grain boundaries are precisely known, several statistics like histogram of grain size or the number of neighbouring grains can be easily retrieved.\r\n\r\nGrainAutLine follows a semi-automatic approach: a special drawing application is provided which has many high-level functions to accelerate the drawing of the grain boundaries. Our goal is to achieve an almost entirely automatic solution, but as this is not realistic in many applications, the user is given the chance to fully supervise all operations, and apply corrections whenever necessary. This way, the user does not have to rely on the automatic functions, but as the system is evolving, with time, less and less user interaction will be required.\r\n\r\n### Usage and conditions\r\n\r\nThe GrainAutLine system is open source, freely available on github.com. The authors encourage everyone to try it and are happy to receive any feedback, feature suggestions, or collaboration opportunities. You can contact the development team via Kristóf Csorba (@csorbakristof).\r\n\r\nThe application is published under the GNU General Public License GPLv3.\r\n\r\nIf you use GrainAutLine in a scientific project, please cite it as follows:\r\n\r\nKristóf Csorba, Lilla Barancsuk, Balázs Székely and Judit Zöldföldi: \"GrainAutLine - A Supervised Grain Boundary Extraction Tool Supported by Image Processing and Pattern Recognition\", in Proceedings of Association for the Study of Marble & Other Stones In Antiquity (ASMOSIA) XI.
